## Divide The Apples
This Python script allows you to check whether a range of numbers is a divisor of a given number of apples. It was inspired by the popular character Jethalal.

### How it Works
The script takes three inputs from the user: the number of apples Jethalal has, the minimum number in the range, and the maximum number in the range. It then determines whether each number within the range is a divisor of the given number of apples.

If the minimum and maximum numbers in the range are the same, it is treated as a single number, and the script checks whether that number is a divisor of the given number of apples.

The script provides an output for each number within the range, indicating whether it is a divisor of the given number of apples or not.

### Getting Started
Clone the repository or download the Python script.
Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
Run the script using a Python interpreter.
Follow the prompts to enter the number of apples, the minimum number in the range, and the maximum number in the range.
The script will output whether each number within the range is a divisor of the given number of apples.
